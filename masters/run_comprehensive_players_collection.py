Comprehensive NBA Players Historical Data Collection

This script rebuilds the master players tables with ALL historical seasons,
not just the current season. This provides the proper foundation for
comprehensive player dashboard data collection.

Before: Only current season players (e.g., ~450 NBA players for 2024-25)
After: ALL player-season combinations (e.g., ~2,500 players √ó ~78 seasons = 195,000+ records)

Usage:
    python run_comprehensive_players_collection.py --mode test     # Test with 5 recent seasons
    python run_comprehensive_players_collection.py --mode full    # Full historical collection
