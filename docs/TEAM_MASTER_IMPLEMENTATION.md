## Team Master Table Implementation Summary

### Problem Identified
Distributed endpoint jobs were failing with `'requires positional argument 'team_id'` because there was no team master table to provide team IDs for team-based endpoints.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Added Team Master Endpoint
**Updated `config/endpoint_config.json`:**
- Added `CommonTeamYears` as master endpoint with `"master": "team_id"`
- This endpoint requires only `league_id` (no team_id needed)
- Returns comprehensive list of all NBA teams that have existed

#### 2. Enhanced Column Name Mapping
**Updated `get_master_table_column_name()` method:**
- Added team ID column variations: `['teamid', 'team_id', 'id']`
- NBA API typically uses `teamid` (not `team_id`)

#### 3. Updated Team Query Methods
**Fixed `_get_missing_team_ids()` method:**
- Now uses master table instead of hardcoded team list
- Uses dynamic column name detection
- Supports both test and production modes

**Fixed `_get_missing_team_season_combinations()` method:**
- Updated to accept `master_table` parameter
- Gets teams from master table instead of hardcoded list
- Maintains efficient combination generation for historical backfill

#### 4. Updated Master Table Resolution
**Modified endpoint processing logic:**
- Team-only endpoints now get `master_nba_teams` table
- Team+season combination endpoints use team master table
- Proper error handling when master table doesn't exist

### Master Tables Now Supported
1. **Games Master**: `master_nba_games` (from LeagueGameFinder)
   - Column: `gameid`
   - Comprehensive game history (1996-2025)

2. **Players Master**: `master_nba_players` (from CommonAllPlayers)  
   - Column: `personid`
   - All players across seasons

3. **Teams Master**: `master_nba_teams` (from CommonTeamYears)
   - Column: `teamid` 
   - All NBA teams that have existed

### Testing Results
✅ All three master endpoints detected correctly  
✅ Standardized table naming working  
✅ Column name mapping includes team variations  
✅ No syntax errors in updated code

### Impact on Distributed System
Your distributed HPC jobs should now be able to:
1. Run `CommonTeamYears` master job first to populate team master table
2. Run team-based endpoints that correctly query the team master table
3. Process team+season combinations for comprehensive historical data
4. Handle all NBA API column name variations automatically

The `'requires positional argument 'team_id'` error should be resolved as endpoints can now get team IDs from the master table.
